Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **DrawL: Understanding the Effects of Non-Mainstream Dialects in Prompted
Image Generation** (arXiv: [arXiv ID]). This repository hosts the dataset used in the research in order to provide easy access for replication, analysis, and further exploration.

About the Dataset

The DrawL dataset comprises a collection of contrastive prompts for image generation models in Mainstream American English (MAE) and African American English (AAE), e.g.,

| Mainstream American English                             | African American English                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A closeup of a person. They put sunglasses on their cat | A closeup of a person. They done put sunglasses on their cat |

The dataset is divided into a set of  minimal, syntax-only changes to the MAE prompts that express grammatical constructions found AAE. Each prompt is labeled with the grammar rule used to construct the contrastive AAE prompt.

 This data may facilitate experiments in which one would like to investigate behavior changes of language models with respect to the dialect of the user.
